Please note that this gem requires access to an Stomp broker and a good 
understanding of Stomp and remote participants in general.

Join us in #ruote on Freenode or on the openwfe-users Google Group to discuss
it's uses.

You might also want to look at daemon-kit for help with writing external
participants that communicate with ruote via Stomp.
